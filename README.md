This repository is the **toolkit**, not a brain itself. Install it once, then run `brain-setup`
inside any project: it scaffolds a [`BRAIN.md`](./skills/brain-setup/assets/BRAIN.md) protocol
file and a `brain/` directory into **your** repo. From then on, any coding agent — Claude Code,
Codex, anything that reads files — learns to use that brain just by reading the project's
`BRAIN.md`. The brain is plain Markdown, lives in the repo, and outlives every session.

## Why a brain

A coding agent's knowledge lives nowhere durable. The reasons behind a decision, the
constraints you agreed on, the path *not* taken — they sit in chat logs and in your head,
and they vanish the moment the session ends. The next agent starts from zero.

A brain fixes that. It is the project's **persistent memory**: the durable decisions,
requirements, and constraints, written down as plain Markdown next to the code.

- **Repo-native** — Markdown that lives in your project and travels in git, with or without a runtime on top.
- **Agent-agnostic** — the contract is a file (`BRAIN.md`). Any agent that can read it can use the brain.
- **Correct by construction** — every write goes through the `brain` CLI, so the brain's
  invariants can't be broken by a malformed edit. There is no validator because none is needed.

The test for what belongs in it: **will this still matter in six months, and is it hard to
reconstruct from the code itself?** If yes, it goes in the brain. Pure implementation details
and anything readable straight from the code and git history stay where they are.

## Quick start

**1. Install the tools once (global):**

```bash
./setup        # symlinks skills/ into every detected agent (~/.claude/skills, ~/.codex/skills, …)
./uninstall    # reverses it cleanly; never touches any project's brain data
```

**2. Initialize a project** — run the **brain-setup** skill in it. It scaffolds `BRAIN.md` +
the brain skeleton, wires the chosen agents' config files, and can install a pre-commit hook.

**3. Seed real knowledge** — run the **brain-bootstrap** skill. On an existing project it reads
the code, docs, and `git log` to draft the root pages and capture key decisions; on a near-empty
one it interviews you. (Setup leaves the brain empty on purpose — seeding is a separate, deliberate step.)

**4. Work as usual.** The agent reads and writes the brain only through the `brain` CLI,
following `BRAIN.md` — brain files are never hand-edited.

**Using code-server?** The [`extension/`](./extension) directory packages steps 2–4 as an
installable code-server / VS Code extension: it offers to scaffold a workspace on open, guards
the brain dir against hand edits, watches commits, and routes anything worth capturing through a
review step — see [`extension/README.md`](./extension/README.md).

## See it work

The point of a brain is what happens *across* sessions — a decision made today is still
there, with its rationale, weeks later:

```text
You    Let's store config as Markdown, not SQLite — easier to diff and migrate.

Agent  Capturing that as a decision so it outlives this session.
       $ brain create-page --id config-as-markdown --category decision \
             --title "Store config as Markdown, not SQLite"
       ✓ page created · indexed

— three weeks and a fresh session later —

You    Why aren't we using a database for config?

Agent  $ brain read-page config-as-markdown
       We chose Markdown for diff-ability and zero migrations. Here's the original call
       and the trade-offs we weighed …
```

## The `brain` CLI

Reading and writing the brain both go through one zero-dependency Node CLI (run with `node`):

```bash
brain() { node skills/brain-page/bin/brain.mjs "$@"; }

brain brain-dir                              # where is the brain?
brain list-pages                             # list pages
brain read-page my-decision                  # read a page
brain create-page --id my-decision --category decision --title "Use X over Y"
echo "the new understanding" | brain update-truth --id my-decision --summary "why it changed"
brain append-timeline --id my-decision --kind evidence --summary "benchmark confirmed it"
echo "## Overview …" | brain update-root architecture
brain wire --agent claude-code,codex,opencode,cursor,pi   # wire CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md to BRAIN.md
brain reindex && brain lint-links
```

A page carries a rewritable **compiled_truth** (the current best understanding) plus an
append-only **timeline** (the chain of evidence). `update-truth` rewrites the truth and appends
its timeline entry in one atomic write — so the understanding can never change without a trace.

## How it works

Three design choices keep the brain durable and tamper-evident:

- **Correct by construction, no validator.** The CLI is the only writer. Frontmatter is always
  generated, and `update-truth` rewrites understanding + records why in a single atomic write.
  The two things a validator used to guard are now structurally impossible.
- **Exactly one brain, location-independent.** It defaults to `./brain`, but a project can
  redirect it via `brainRoot` in `.mindmux/preferences.json` (e.g. an external sidecar). Every
  command resolves the location itself — tools never create a second, shadow brain.
- **Pure files, portable.** The brain is Markdown plus one Node script — it lives in your repo
  and travels in git, and runtimes (MindMux over MCP, more to come) layer on top of the same files.

The skills that drive it all:

| skill | what it does |
|---|---|
| **brain-setup** | scaffold `BRAIN.md` + the brain skeleton, wire agent configs, optional pre-commit hook |
| **brain-bootstrap** | seed the brain from code / docs / `git log` — or interview you on a greenfield project |
| **brain-page** | the operating manual for reading and writing pages + root pages (carries the `brain` CLI) |
| **brain-ingest** | digest a conversation, document, or research result into the brain |
